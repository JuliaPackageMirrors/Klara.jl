Rationale behind states
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Being geared towards statistics, *Lora* variables include parameters, data, transformations and constants, the specifics of
which will be delineated in the next chapter. A variable, be it stochastic or deterministic, can take a value, that is it
can have a *state*. Variables and their states are maintained in two distinct type systems in *Lora*.

The functionality of a variable is enclosed by its type instance. For a example, a typical parameter consists of its
probability distribution, log-likelihood or log-prior fields.

It is possible to store the value of a multivariate variable in a vector. However, it might be required to save additional
information. For example, the value of a parameter's log-likelihood and associated gradient might be of interest. Variable
state types exist to accommodate such states that comprise two or more entities.

From an object-oriented programming (OOP) standpoint, variable types correspond to methods while variable state types
constitute data members. *Lora* does not merge the functional and data components into a single type, which would had been
the analogous of a class in OOP terms. The main reasoning behind Lora's compartmentalization of variables and their states is
code reusability. For instance, it becomes possible for different variables to share the same state type; more generally,
adhering to Julia's multiple dispatch is facilitated.

Moreover, keeping states separate from variables helps cater to user-specific problems. Existing functionality can be
deployed on user-defined states tailored to the problem at hand.
