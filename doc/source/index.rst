The Julia *MCMC* package provides a generic engine for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference. Briefly, *MCMC*
implements:

* serial and sequential Monte Carlo methods,
* imperative model specification,
* a range of Monte Carlo samplers,
* summary statistics for MCMC and MCMC diagnostic tools,
* output managemement and output post-processing,
* various job managers for controlling the flow of simulations,
* resuming Monte Carlo simulations,
* Monte Carlo sampling with the help of automatic differentiation.
