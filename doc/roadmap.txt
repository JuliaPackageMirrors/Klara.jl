While todo.txt provides a general list of improvements in the longer run, roadmap.txt prescribes a coherent sequence of
action points for the near future:

1) Port all remaining functionality from older MCMC.jl to Lora.jl
2) Finish readthedocs for ported functionality
3) Redesign model specification using factor graphs
4) Refactor implementation of chains to facilitate the implementation of a Gibbs sampler
5) Implement a generic Gibbs sampler on the basis of the new factor graph-based model
6) Extend readthedocs
7) Define a wider selection of MCMC diagnostics
8) Extend readthedocs
9) Write a coherent test suite for all the above
