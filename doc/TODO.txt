01) Add tuners based on established adaptive MCMC schemes
02) Port empirical tuner from GeometricMCMC
03) Allow storage of gradients in runners
04) Port zero-variance estimators from GeometricMCMC
05) Extend MCMCLikModel constructor to allow for user-inputed evalall functions
06) Possibly split RWM according to employed tuner
07) Extend autodiff capabilities for MCMC samplers that need higher order derivatives
08) Update README file to reflect current state of MCMC package
09) Write a user guide using LaTeX (to be placed in doc directory)
10) Organize Bayesian logit and probit examples and tests better, until GLM provides Bayesian methods
11) Add RMLMC (Semi-Explicit Riemmanian Manifold Lagrangian Monte Carlo) sampler
12) Add eRMLMC (Explicit Riemmanian Manifold Lagrangian Monte Carlo) sampler
13) Add PMALA (Position Independent MALA) sampler
14) Add WHMC (Wormhole Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) sampler
15) Design and implement parallel population MCMC capable of running on cluster workers
16) Use BUGS approach using graphical models to define Gibbs-based algorithms
17) Implement MCMC diagnostic tools and stats mostly on the basis of the R coda package
